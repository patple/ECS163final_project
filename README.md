# ECS163 Project Implementation #

This is our repo for the interactive slide show. The code that makes up the bulk of our project is stored within. streamgraph.js and bargraph.js uses D3 to implement the visuals we use throughout our interactive slide show.
Furthermore, we created a custom slide API that allows us to appened any visual we create through JS. With the visualization methods and slide API are called in the main.js to create the slide show. The interative elements such as buttons are handled in the index.html and style.css which stores all our styling for each slide. Also our search function was created using JS and is stored in the main.js. The data set we used is a list of the top 2000 selling games. This dataset can be found in the data folders within apps. 


How to run the slides 
1. First download code and extract from ZIP
2. Make sure you have the live server extension installed for VS code 
3. Right click on index.html in the main directory and click "Open with live server"
