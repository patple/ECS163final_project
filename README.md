# ECS163 Project Implementation #

This repo is the final project for ECS 162, which is an interactive slideshow that visualizes data about the top 2,000 best selling games from 1980 to 2016.
The data was obtained from Kaggle and each game has their title, publisher, release date, genre, platform, and sales which were separated into regions. We utilize D3.js to create the visual graphs such as stream graphs and bar graphs. We also have a custom slide API that creates our slides and allows us to attach our visuals to them.
The main files that handle the implementations of the visualizations are streamgraph.js and bargraph.js which are located in the apps folder. Our styling of the slides were handled with HTML
CSS.

Uncut Data Set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales/data

We feel our trimmed data set is small with only 2,000 entries, so we left it in the repository as is.
