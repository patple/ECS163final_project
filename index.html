                    This is an interactive slide show aimmed to show you the video game trends over the years 
                    espically the trends in publishers and generes around the world. Since our group members have 
                    personal connections with games we found it interesting to share this data with you.

                 <p>
                    The data set we will presenting was gathered from kaggle and records the sales of over
                    16,500 video games from 1980 to 2016. This data set is has many componets to it such as the 
                    the game title, when it was released, it's publishers and sales in each major region. However 
                    16,500 video games are way to many to display with the visualiazations we are showing you today.
                    We have trimmed the list down to the top 2000 games by sales.

                <h2>What is a  Stream Graph?</h2>
                <p>
                    A stream graph is a type of stacked area graph where the information 
                    is usally displayed around the central axis. This allows for a flowing shape
                    that can show certain trends. We thought this would be a good visualization to 
                    display the change of video game genres and it's publishers over time. These graphs 
                    will help you see which publishers and genre where popular during each time period.

                <h2>How to Read a Stream Graph</h2>
                   <ol>
                        <li><strong>Identify the X-axis</strong>: Since our X-axis is time we read the graph from left to right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify the Y-axis</strong> : Since our Y-axis is sales in the millions it shows the total vlaue at each time point.
                            Also there are no negative values on the Y-axis.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Streams</strong>: Each stream is a specific category which is color coded.</li>
                        <li><strong>Thickness of Streams</strong>: thicker means more during that time period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow a Stream</strong>: see how the categor changes over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for Patterns</strong>: spikes, dipps, growing or shrinking show trends</li>

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in North America</h1>
            <p>
                From the early years it seems that Nintendo dominated the gaming space in the North American market. Around the early 1990s we started 
                to see new publishers growing. Some notable publishers are Electronic Arts and Activation which are both American publishers while Nintendo is Japanese. 
                However in the early 2000s the popularity of Nintendo rose again and seems to die down in the 2010s.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Europe</h1>
            <p>
                Similar to the North American Graph we see a strong dominance by Nintendo in the early years of gaming with a large spike in the early 2000s. 
                There are some differences such as Ubisoft, a French Publisher being in the top 5 publishers. However the space is still being dominated by Nintendo, EA, and Activation.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Japan</h1>
            <p>
               This time we see a very strong and consistent presence from Nintendo. Also 9 out of the publishers displayed are all domestic publishers while EA being placed 10th is a North American publisher. 
               This could represent that the Japanese region preferes domestic game publishers over foreign ones.

            <p>
                This graph shows the sales in the non major regions we can see that EA is at the top of the sales instead of Nintendo and there seems to be a more even distribution of sales between the 
                publishers

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in North America</h1>
            <p>
               In the North American market we see that shooters and action games are at the top of the list. 
               This further supports the publishers list since EA and Activation were the top 3 publishers in North America. These American publishers primarily produce FPS(First Person Shooter) 
               games and action games.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Europe</h1>
            <p>
               Similar to the North American graph we see a strong presence in action and shooter however sports takes 2nd place over shooter games. 
               This could be due to the strong football culture within the European region.
            </p>

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Japan</h1>
            <p>
              As for Japan we see that role-playing games dominate the market. 
              This is due to the fact that most Japanese developers produce role-playing games and there are even a subgenre of RPGs called JRPGs ( Japanese Role Playing Game) since they usually have a 
              unique style and gameplay to them compared to their North American or European counterparts.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Other Countries</h1>
            <p>
                In this graph we see that the top 3 are action, sports and shooters. 
                They all have a similar distribution. We also see there was a massive spike in shooters during 2007 and 2008 most likely due to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.
