                <p> 
                    This is an interactive slide show aimmed to show you the video game trends over the years 
                    especially the trends in publishers and generes around the world. Since our group members have 
                    personal connections with games we found it interesting to share this data with you.

                 <p>
                    The data set we will presenting was gathered from kaggle and records the sales of over
                    16,500 video games from 1980 to 2016. This data set is has many componets to it such as the 
                    the game title, when it was released, it's publishers and sales in each major region. However 
                    16,500 video games are way to many to display with the visualiazations we are showing you today.
                    We have trimmed the list down to the top 2000 games by sales.

                <h2>What is a Stream Graph?</h2>
                <p>
                    A stream graph is a type of stacked area graph where the information 
                    is usally displayed around the central axis. This allows for a flowing shape
                    that can show certain trends. We thought this would be a good visualization to 
                    display the change of video game genres and it's publishers over time. These graphs 
                    will help you see which publishers and genre where popular during each time period.

                <h2>How to Read a Stream Graph</h2>
                   <ol>
                        <li><strong>Identify the X-axis</strong>: Since our X-axis is time we read the graph from left to right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identify the Y-axis</strong> : Since our Y-axis is sales in the millions it shows the total vlaue at each time point.
                            Also there are no negative values on the Y-axis.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The Streams</strong>: Each stream is a specific category which is color coded.</li>
                        <li><strong>Thickness of Streams</strong>: thicker means more during that time period.</li>
                        <li><strong>Follow a Stream</strong>: see how the categor changes over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Look for Patterns</strong>: spikes, dipps, growing or shrinking show trends</li>

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in North America</h1>
            <p>
                Nintendo had an early hold on the NA market, but in the mid-1990s, we started to see new American publishers like Electronic Arts and 
                Activision gain momentum. Starting in the 2000s, the majority of the top publishers in NA seem to be American, showing a strong domestic 
                market for video games. The exceptions, as shown in the stream graph, are Nintendo, Sega, and Ubisoft.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Europe</h1>
            <p>
                The EU market has a similar story to NA, where Nintendo had an early presence and was the sole prominent publisher until the rise of American publishers 
                in the mid-1990s. Interestingly, the presence of video games, including Nintendo, were small in the EU region until the 2000s, when it saw a major boom in sales. 
                This could suggest that before the 2000s, conditions were not suited for the growth of video games; perhaps Nintendo saw EU as a small market until then.
                EU did not have a strong domestic market, sharing many of their top publishers with NA, where the majority are American.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Japan</h1>
            <p>
               Japan has a very strong and consistent video game culture, of course being kickstarted by Nintendo. As early as the 1980s, video games have had a large presence in Japan, 
               showing less relative growth than the other regions. Japan also has an incredible domestic market, where 9 of 10 top publishers are based in Japan, with the sole exception 
               being Electronic Arts. The graph also shows that Japan’s video game market is heavily and consistently dominated by Nintendo. It would be literally true to say that Nintendo 
               makes up over half of all of Japan’s video game sales.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Other Countries</h1>
            <p>
                There are a few notable things to point out about video game markets in Other regions. The rise of video gaming is slow, slower than even EU. Video game sales did not really take
                off until 2004, with a boom in sales between Take-Two, Nintendo, and Sony, primarily. Sales also have a smaller absolute peak than all of the other regions, capping 
                out at 90M for Electronic Arts, compared to the other minimum of 395M for Nintendo in Japan. This could either suggest that the data we had is incomplete and 
                misses sales from these regions, or there wasn’t a strong market for video games, whether it be by publisher choice or other conditions. This group of regions 
                is also the only one where Nintendo is not the top 1 publisher, losing to Electronic Arts, showing EA’s willingness to appeal to foreign markets. The lack of new 
                publishers in this area also shows the dominance of American and Japanese publishers in video game markets.
            </p>

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Other Countries</h1>
            <p>
                The summed up sales for all publishers is remarkably similar to the NA region. This is possibly because of NA’s lead in absolute numbers, with a similar number of sales 
                to every other region combined. The graph paints a clear picture of video game publisher history. Nintendo was an early giant with nearly no competition until the 
                mid-1990s with the rise of American publishers. In the global market, Nintendo still reigns supreme, but regional publisher dominance is split between NA and Japan. 
                Japanese publishers are mostly represented with the titan Nintendo and to a smaller extent, Sony. NA publishers have lesser dominance individually, but as a region, 
                they rival Japan’s presence in the global market.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in North America</h1>
            <p>
               In the North American market we see that shooters and action games are at the top of the list. 
               This further supports the publishers list since EA and Activation were the top 3 publishers in North America. These American publishers primarily produce FPS(First Person Shooter) 
               games and action games.

            <p>
               Similar to the North American graph we see a strong presence in action and shooter however sports takes 2nd place over shooter games. 
               This could be due to the strong football culture within the European region.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Japan</h1>
            <p>
              As for Japan we see that role-playing games dominate the market. 
              This is due to the fact that most Japanese developers produce role-playing games and there are even a subgenre of RPGs called JRPGs ( Japanese Role Playing Game) since they usually have a 
              unique style and gameplay to them compared to their North American or European counterparts.

            <p>
                In this graph we see that the top 3 are action, sports and shooters. 
                They all have a similar distribution. We also see there was a massive spike in shooters during 2007 and 2008 most likely due to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.

            <p>
                The global graph for the genre shows that the peak of gaming was around 2007 to 2009. 
                With action, sports and shooters being the top 3.

                    Overall the publisher trends throughout each region were quite similar Nintendo was the first place for the main 3 regions showing that the publisher was consistent in their
                    games and made a huge impact on the gaming industry. Furthermore all the graphs tend to follow the same teardrop pattern. This shows that gaming as a hobby had a very low presence in the early
                    1990s and started to boom around the 2000s and 2010s. However the Japanese region is a lot different than the other graphs showing a major spike in the late 1990s and another in the early 2000s.

                   The European and North American graphs share very similar trends in genres. Both regions have a similar top 3 of action, shooter, and sports. 
                   While Japan has RPGs and platformer games dominating the market. This is most likely due to the heavy Nintendo presence since games such as Mario are platformers.
                   As for the European and North American the preference in shooters stem from Activation being both of the top publishers in both regions. Producing games such as the Call of Duty franchise.
                   Furthermore the spike in sales in genres for each of the graph correlates with the spikes in the publisher graph.
