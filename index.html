                    This is an interactive slide show aimmed to show you the video game trends over the years 
                    especially the trends in publishers and generes around the world. Since our group members have 
                    personal connections with games we found it interesting to share this data with you.

                 <p>
                    The data set we will presenting was gathered from kaggle and records the sales of over
                    16,500 video games from 1980 to 2016. This data set is has many componets to it such as the 
                    the game title, when it was released, it's publishers and sales in each major region. However 
                    16,500 video games are way to many to display with the visualiazations we are showing you today.
                    We have trimmed the list down to the top 2000 games by sales.

                <p>
                    A stream graph is a type of stacked area graph where the information 
                    is usally displayed around the central axis. This allows for a flowing shape
                    that can show certain trends. We thought this would be a good visualization to 
                    display the change of video game genres and it's publishers over time. These graphs 
                    will help you see which publishers and genre where popular during each time period.

                        <li><strong>Identify the Y-axis</strong> : Since our Y-axis is sales in the millions it shows the total vlaue at each time point.
                            Also there are no negative values on the Y-axis.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in North America</h1>
            <p>
                Nintendo had an early hold on the NA market, but in the mid-1990s, we started to see new American publishers like Electronic Arts and 
                Activision gain momentum. Starting in the 2000s, the majority of the top publishers in NA seem to be American, showing a strong domestic 
                market for video games. The exceptions, as shown in the stream graph, are Nintendo, Sega, and Ubisoft.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Europe</h1>
            <p>
                The EU market has a similar story to NA, where Nintendo had an early presence and was the sole prominent publisher until the rise of American publishers 
                in the mid-1990s. Interestingly, the presence of video games, including Nintendo, were small in the EU region until the 2000s, when it saw a major boom in sales. 
                This could suggest that before the 2000s, conditions were not suited for the growth of video games; perhaps Nintendo saw EU as a small market until then.
                EU did not have a strong domestic market, sharing many of their top publishers with NA, where the majority are American.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Japan</h1>
            <p>
               Japan has a very strong and consistent video game culture, of course being kickstarted by Nintendo. As early as the 1980s, video games have had a large presence in Japan, 
               showing less relative growth than the other regions. Japan also has an incredible domestic market, where 9 of 10 top publishers are based in Japan, with the sole exception 
               being Electronic Arts. The graph also shows that Japan’s video game market is heavily and consistently dominated by Nintendo. It would be literally true to say that Nintendo 
               makes up over half of all of Japan’s video game sales.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales in Other Regions</h1>
            <p>
                There are a few notable things to point out about video game markets in Other regions. The rise of video gaming is slow, slower than even EU. Video game sales did not really take
                off until 2004, with a boom in sales between Take-Two, Nintendo, and Sony, primarily. Sales also have a smaller absolute peak than all of the other regions, capping 
                out at 90M for Electronic Arts, compared to the other minimum of 395M for Nintendo in Japan. This could either suggest that the data we had is incomplete and 
                misses sales from these regions, or there wasn’t a strong market for video games, whether it be by publisher choice or other conditions. This group of regions 
                is also the only one where Nintendo is not the top 1 publisher, losing to Electronic Arts, showing EA’s willingness to appeal to foreign markets. The lack of new 
                publishers in this area also shows the dominance of American and Japanese publishers in video game markets.

            <h1>Key Insights About Publisher Sales Globally</h1>
            <p>
                The summed up sales for all publishers is remarkably similar to the NA region. This is possibly because of NA’s lead in absolute numbers, with a similar number of sales 
                to every other region combined. The graph paints a clear picture of video game publisher history. Nintendo was an early giant with nearly no competition until the 
                mid-1990s with the rise of American publishers. In the global market, Nintendo still reigns supreme, but regional publisher dominance is split between America and Japan. 
                Japanese publishers are mostly represented with the titan Nintendo and to a smaller extent, Sony. American publishers have lesser dominance individually, but as a region, 
                they rival Japan’s presence in the global market.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in North America</h1>
            <p>
                The NA market features most prominently Action, Shooter, and Sports games. Given NA’s preference of domestic publishers and the reputation of 
                American publishers to put out these exact genres of games, especially Electronic Arts and Activision, this is a clear connection to the publishers. 
                The runner-up of Platformers is likely attributed to the presence of Nintendo in the market. Something very notable is that Puzzle games had a large 
                bump in 1989 and never had significant relevance again. It would be more apt to say a singular Puzzle game, since this short period of dominance in 
                the Puzzle genre was most likely solely caused by Tetris (1989) for the NES, showing, in a funny way, the sheer popularity of Tetris.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Europe</h1>
            <p>
                The EU market for genres is nearly identical to the NA market with only minor shifts in placements. Considering the EU market for publishers was 
                also similar, this is another connection to the publishers. While the small changes are generally not particularly noteworthy, it is interesting 
                to see the placement swap of Shooters and Sports in the EU region compared to NA. Looking at the numbers, this is not a fluke, since Sports are 
                meaningfully ahead of Shooters in EU and vice versa in NA. This is a difference that could possibly be explained by a difference in culture. EU 
                generally has a stronger sports culture than NA, while NA most definitely has a stronger gun culture than EU.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Japan</h1>
            <p>
                Similar to the publisher graph, Japan has vastly different tastes than the other regions. The Shooter genre, near the top in NA and EU, is 
                downgraded to being one of the least popular genres in Japan. Meanwhile, Role-Playing Games dominate by far. This can be attributed to the 
                widespread nature of Role-Playing Games in Japan, with many different Japanese publishers holding popular Role-Playing Game IPs, like Final 
                Fantasy, Fire Emblem, and Dragon Quest. The publisher Square Enix (and before their merger as Square and Enix) is especially widely known for 
                their dominance in Role-Playing Games, and sure enough, Japan is the only region where they are not only popular, but a leading Publisher when 
                combining their shared works. So influential are Japanese publishers’ Role-Playing Games that there exists a subgenre known as Japanese Role-Playing 
                Games (JRPGs) that often share common elements not found in Western Role-Playing Games.

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Other Countries</h1>
            <p>
                Interestingly, the Other regions share a fairly similar genre trend to the EU region, where Action, Sports, and Shooters are ahead of the pack, 
                in that order. This can possibly be attributed to closer cultural similarities between the EU region and the rest of the world. Something noteworthy 
                is that Platformers are less popular outside of the major regions. This can be connected to the lack of Nintendo’s presence in these markets, 
                since, again, these are the only markets where Nintendo is not the topmost publisher. 
            </p>

            <h1>Key Insights About Genre Popularity in Other Countries</h1>
            <p>
                The summed up sales for all genres globally are fairly balanced over time. There are no extreme fluctuations that are obvious besides the Tetris 
                bump of 1989. There are similar peaks as the other regions in game sales, especially around 2007 to 2009. Overall, this is a good graph to 
                show the general popularity of game genres, not just over time.

                    As can be easily seen, publisher trends differ a lot between regions. While some things stay sort of similar, like the presence of 
                    Nintendo and the growth of video games at the turn of the millennium, the general trends might be different. EU’s market is similar to 
                    NA, but Japan’s market is vastly different. The Other regions also have key differences that set them apart from the main regions. The stream 
                    graph does not let us easily speculate into why these trends might be different, other than what we previously know about publishers and 
                    their home markets, but the insights from this do prompt discussion and let us ask questions that could answer why trends are set. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A previous point made in the insights for EU and Other regions’ top publishers was that it could be publisher’s choice to market their games to a certain 
                    region. Indeed, we do know that publishers will prioritize regions that they see as valuable consumers for their products. Thus, the trends 
                    of publishers in regions could possibly be as arbitrary as a board of director’s whim to either follow existing trends or break into new markets. 
                    However, this is only a single possible explanation, and more discussion is warranted as to why certain trends may be set, such exploration into the 
                    economic conditions or work culture of a region at certain times.

                 <p>
                   The European and North American graphs share very similar trends in genres. Both regions have a similar top 3 of action, shooter, and sports. 
                   While Japan has RPGs and platformer games dominating the market. This is most likely due to the heavy Nintendo presence since games such as Mario are platformers.
                   As for the European and North American the preference in shooters stem from Activation being both of the top publishers in both regions. Producing games such as the Call of Duty franchise.
                   Furthermore the spike in sales in genres for each of the graph correlates with the spikes in the publisher graph.
