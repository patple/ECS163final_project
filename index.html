                <p> 
                    This is an interactive slide show aimmed to show you the video game trends over the years 
                    espically the trends in publishers and generes around the world. Since our group members have 
                    personal connections with games we found it interesting to share this data with you.

                    The data set we will presenting was gathered from kaggle and records the sales of over
                    16,500 video games from 1980 to 2016. This data set is has many componets to it such as the 
                    the game title, when it was released, it's publishers and sales in each major region. However 
                    16,500 video games are way to many to display with the visualiazations we are showing you today.
                    We have trimmed the list down to the top 2000 games by sales.

                <h2>What is a  Stream Graph?</h2>
                <p>
                    A stream graph is a type of stacked area graph where the information 
                    is usally displayed around the central axis. This allows for a flowing shape
                    that can show certain trends. We thought this would be a good visualization to 
                    display the change of video game genres and it's publishers over time. These graphs 
                    will help you see which publishers and genre where popular during each time period.
